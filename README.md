# ray-tracing-workshop
Python framework for implementing a ray tracer.

Many parts are left unfinished, and are to be implemented as an exercise.

## Setup
```
pip install pillow
pip install numpy
```

## Running the project
To run the code, execute the following command from the top directory of the project:

```
python main.py
```

The command renders the scene, saves it to `output.png`, and displays the image.

## Tasks
All missing code fragments needed to finish the implementation are marked with comments of the form `TASK X`.

For each task number, there is a correctly rendered image of the example scene in `examples` folder for reference.
